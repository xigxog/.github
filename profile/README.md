# XigXog

A dichotomy exists today: exceptional technologies are being created rapidly in
the Kubernetes space which address real problems in innovative ways. But
leveraging those technologies creates an ever-accelerating burden on DevOps to
the extent that deployment morphs from application-focused to third-party
component and environment-focused. Costs rise, sources of cost become amorphous,
and teams begin to focus on everything but application utility and value.

XigXog was formed to address these problems.
[KubeFox](https://github.com/xigxog/kubefox) will be our first product focused
in this area. It will facilitate the development, deployment, and management of
Kubernetes applications.
