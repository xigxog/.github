# XigXog Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the XigXog team and community is
composed of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world,
working on every aspect of the mission - including development, maintenance,
documentation, mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity in a community is a tremendous strength; hence, we seek to cultivate
it. A healthy community comprises people of all backgrounds and identities.
Those differences may sometimes lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To
that end, we have a few ground rules to which we ask people to adhere. This code
applies equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by XigXog and all forms of
communication, including but not limited to chat mechanisms, IRCs, mailing
lists, issue trackers, XigXog events, and any other forums created by the XigXog
team which the community uses for communication. In addition, it includes
violations of this code outside of these spaces that may affect a person's
ability to participate within them.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing conduct@xigxog.io. For more details please see our Reporting
Guide.

- **Be friendly and patient.**
- **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
  members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
  status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
  gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
  religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
  will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be
  communicating in someone else's primary language.
- **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
  no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the XigXog
  community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with
  people outside the XigXog community.
- **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
  professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
  not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
  behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

  - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  - Discriminatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
    information ("doxing").
  - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  - Unwelcome sexual attention.
  - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  - Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then
    stop.

  In short, treat others the way you wish to be treated.

- **When disagreements occur, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both
  social and technical, happen all the time and XigXog is no exception. Passion
  revolving around qualitative aspects of the code base is not a bad thing.
  However, it is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
  constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of the XigXog
  community derives from its varied participants. Different people have
  different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
  a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.
- **All of us make mistakes.** It is human to err. Spending time working to
  assign blame yields pointless conflict. And blaming each other doesn’t get us
  anywhere. Instead, focus that energy on helping to resolve issues and learning
  from mistakes.

## Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report
it to XigXog by emailing conduct@xigxog.io. All reports will be kept
confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will
remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still
report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take
no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look
negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about
incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help
us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a
  mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from XigXog Conduct Review Committee acknowledging
receipt. We strive to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and will aim for much
quicker than that).

The committee will immediately meet to review the incident and determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the working groups' immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that the
situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing
  list or IRC).
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all XigXog spaces (mailing lists,
  IRC, etc.)
- A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either a
resolution or an explanation for why the situation is not yet resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter to
let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll take into account
feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but we don't
guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the committee will file a report on the situation with XigXog. XigXog
may choose to publish a public report of the incident (however and as noted
earlier, the identities of any victims or reports will be kept confidential).

### What if your report concerns a possible violation by a committee member?

If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct committee, you
may not feel comfortable sending your report to the committee, as all members
will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to coc_review@xigxog.io. That will
trigger a review by a different body within XigXog. The usual enforcement
process will be conducted, but any member(s) that the report concerns will be
excluded from all discussion or decision making.

### Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration of
the committee's decision. To make such a request, contact XigXog at
coc_review@xigxog.io with your request and motivation and XigXog will review
the case.
