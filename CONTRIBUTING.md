# XigXog Contribution Guide

First and foremost: **Welcome!**

We appreciate your interest in XigXog and in our first product, KubeFox.  And we look forward to your contributions!

We ask that you please read XigXog's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/xigxog/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Ways to Contribute

For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue. Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you're trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it's truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step -- but as the subject says, when it doubt, open an issue.

The links below point to the different pieces of KubeFox, and take you directly to issue creation.

- Feature Request

### Contributor License Agreement

XigXog requires all external contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for all contributions.  You can find the full text of the XigXog CLA [here](https://github.com/xigxog/.github/blob/main/CLA.md).

This is a simple English (non-legalese) summary of (and not a substitute for) the full agreement. It highlights some of key terms of the CLA. It has no legal standing and you should carefully review all the terms of the actual CLA before agreeing.

- **Grant of copyright license.**  You give XigXog permission to use your copyrighted work in commercial products.
- **Grant of patent license.** If your contributed work uses a patent, you give XigXog a license to use that patent including within commercial products. You also agree that you have permission to grant this license.
- **No Warranty or Support Obligations.** By making a contribution, you are not obligating yourself to provide support for the contribution, and you are not taking on any warranty obligations or providing any assurances about how it will perform.
  
The CLA does not change the terms of the standard open source license used by our software such as MPL2 or MIT. You are still free to use our projects within your own projects or businesses, republish modified source, and more. Please reference the appropriate license for the project you're contributing to to learn more.

### Why Require a CLA?

Agreeing to a CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution, that you cannot withdraw permission to use your contribution at a later date, and that XigXog has permission to use your contribution in our commercial products.

This removes any ambiguities or uncertainties caused by not having a CLA and allows users and customers to confidently adopt our projects. At the same time, the CLA ensures that all contributions to our open source projects are licensed under the project's respective open source license, such as MPL2.

Requiring a CLA is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. Major open source projects require CLAs such as Apache Software Foundation projects, Facebook projects (such as React), Google projects (including Go), Python, Django, and more. Each of these projects remains licensed under permissive OSS licenses such as MIT, Apache, BSD, and more.

### Signing the CLA

When you open a pull request (PR) to any of our open source projects, you will be asked to sign the CLA (if you have not already). 

Follow the steps given by the bot to sign the CLA. This will require you to log in with GitHub (we only request public information from your account) and to fill in a few additional details such as your name and email address. We will only use this information for CLA tracking; none of your submitted information will be used for marketing purposes.

You only have to sign the CLA once. Once you've signed the CLA, you won't be asked to sign again for any future contributions you make to any XigXog project.
